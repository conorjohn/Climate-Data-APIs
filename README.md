### Climate Data APIs & Useful Organisations
I've been looking for a number of sources of climate data for the last little while and after talking to a paleoclimatologist I was provided a number of resources that I hope to work with in the near future:

NASA is a great resource, so check out their [Data Portal](https://data.nasa.gov/)

If anyone has any contributions to make please do, it would be great to see if there's any more data I can get my hands on 

# Biodiversity APIs 
[Ireland](https://data.gov.ie/dataset?api=false&organization=national-biodiversity-data-centre)

# Crowd Sourced Data
I have been researching some groups and organisations that could possibly benefit from projects created from these APIs

Website | Description | Contact |
------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
[Pollinators](https://pollinators.ie/) | Monitoring the activity of pollintators in Ireland | [pollinators@biodiversityireland.ie](pollinators@biodiversityireland.ie)
[Irish Gov Data](https://data.gov.ie/dataset?api=false&organization=national-biodiversity-data-centre) | An array of apis with ecological data and surveys | Multiple points of contact

# Project Proposal
* Create web portal and app that allows people to browse the Irish government ecological data.
* Next provide a platform to allow users to submit their own sightings, with species, name, picture & location with coordinates.
* These submissions will be reviewed by a researcher before they are offically recorded.
* Combine weather forcasts with the season to alert to the likelyhood of seeing a certain species in a certain area.
